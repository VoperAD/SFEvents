## About the Addon

SFEvents is a Slimefun addon that adds special events to the game, which are related to Slimefun actions, such as
crafting items. Currently, the only event available is the **Crafting Event**, which is triggered when a player crafts
a Slimefun item. In the future, I plan to add more events, such as a Clan version of the Crafting Event, where players
can compete in crafting items for their clans. Feel free to suggest any other events you would like to see in this addon!

> I created this addon mainly to practice my Kotlin skills :)


## Requirements

- This addon works on **Spigot**/**Paper** servers as well as on their forks, such as **Purpur**.
- **Java Version:** 17+
- **Minecraft Version:** 1.16+
- **Slimefun Version:** RC-37+

## Basic Instructions

As said before, the addon currently has only one event â€” the Crafting Event.

All events are stored in a folder called `events`, which is located inside SFEvents folder. Using the command `/sfevents event create <eventType> <eventFileName>`,
you can create a new event file with the specified name and type. Then, you can edit the file to customize the event.

Also, it is possible to schedule events to run at specific times using the `scheduler` field in the **config.yml** file.
